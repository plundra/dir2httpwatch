Synchronizes content of a directory with webclients using socket.io.

How it works
------------
1) Clients connects to server, which sends current filelist.
2) Server watches a directory for changes.
3) On changes (file is added or removed), send notification to clients.

Flaws/Todo
----------
Initial plan was to use inotify for watching directory, but turned out
to be a hassle to learn; so did a polling fs.readdir(). This should be
switched back to the inital plan.
